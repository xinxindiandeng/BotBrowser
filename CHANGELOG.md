# CHANGELOG

> **Research scope:** Entries in this changelog describe features evaluated in authorized labs and defensive benchmarking programs. Follow the [Legal Disclaimer](DISCLAIMER.md) and [Responsible Use Guidelines](RESPONSIBLE_USE.md). We work with security vendors to investigate any misuse, so report concerns to [botbrowser@bk.ru](mailto:botbrowser@bk.ru).


## [2025-12-22]
### Improvements
- **FPS control precision**: Fine‑tuned frame rate simulation logic to deliver more accurate and stable FPS emulation, improving consistency when targeting specific refresh rates and reducing jitter in timing-sensitive scenarios.

### Fixes
- **Iframe content dimensions**: Resolved an edge case where iframe content dimensions (height/width) could be reported as zero in certain layout conditions. Frame boundaries now render consistently.
- **navigator.plugins empty state**: Fixed a scenario where `navigator.plugins` could return an empty collection despite the profile defining valid plugins. Plugin enumeration is now stable across sessions.


## [2025-12-17]
### Major
- **Chromium Core → 143.0.7499.147**: Updated the engine to 143.0.7499.147 to stay aligned with the latest Chrome Stable. This keeps Web Platform behavior, DevTools schemas, and version keyed heuristics in lockstep with upstream.

### New
- **Local DNS solver (ENT Tier1)**: Added a local DNS resolver that can be enabled with `--bot-local-dns`. This improves privacy and resolution speed, avoids common DNS poisoning scenarios, and bypasses DNS limitations imposed by some proxy providers.
- **Custom public IP service**: Added `--bot-ip-service` so you can point BotBrowser at your own IP lookup endpoint when you want full control over how the public egress IP is detected. Multiple endpoints can be provided as a comma-separated list, and BotBrowser will race them and use the fastest successful response.

### Improvements
- **Proxy auth parsing**: Proxy credentials now support additional separators in the username field, including `,` and `｜`. This makes structured usernames work reliably with common proxy provider formats, for example `socks5://user_abc,type_mobile,country_GB,session_1234:11111@portal.proxy.io:1080`.
- **Extension sync (ENT Tier2)**: Updated extension `ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi` to version 1.98.1 to match the latest Chrome Stable packaging and behavior.

### Fixes
- **Windows headless without GPU**: Fixed a startup failure affecting the Windows binary in headless mode when no GPU is available in the environment.
- **Android touch simulation cleanup**: Fixed a memory leak when using Android fingerprints and repeatedly creating and closing contexts, where touch emulation resources were not released correctly.
- **Multi monitor screen offsets**: Fixed incorrect `screenLeft` and `screenTop` values on certain multi monitor setups.


## [2025-12-08]
### New
- **WebGPU canvas noise injector**: Added deterministic noise controls to WebGPU canvas outputs (validated on [webbrowsertools.com/webgpu-fingerprint](https://webbrowsertools.com/webgpu-fingerprint/)) so GPU fingerprints stay aligned with the rest of the noise stack; replayed recordings now preserve the expected variance across browsers that probe WebGPU specifically.
- **Embedded font rendering per platform**: DOM text rendering now stays within the bundled cross-platform font sets (not just fallback chains), so Windows/macOS/Linux/Android simulations paint both DOM and fallback fonts from the same embedded assets, preventing host font leaks when a site walks `document.fonts` or measures inline text.

### Improvements
- **Canvas noise edge-cases**: Fixed a rare convergence case spotted on <https://browserscan.com/canvas> where certain seeds produced identical hashes, preventing host hashes from leaking through and ensuring per-profile canvases remain distinguishable across sessions.
- **HarfBuzz perturbation precision**: Noise applied inside HarfBuzz now respects prior precision and only adjusts `x_advance` / `y_advance` inside a minimal range, which keeps shaping believable on multilingual text (including CJK) while maintaining diversity for creepJS-style text metrics.

### Fixes
- **Pixelscan WebGL noise**: Refined WebGL canvas noise so <http://pixelscan.net> no longer flags the fraud heuristics triggered by earlier, coarse noise injection; multi-pass renders now inherit the same noise field as the base frame.
- **Client Hints DPR parity**: `sec-ch-dpr` now matches `window.devicePixelRatio`, eliminating mismatches between Client Hints metadata and JS-observable values, which removes a quick heuristic some anti-bot flows used to detect spoofed DPIs.


## [2025-12-03]
### Major
- **Chromium Core → 143.0.7499.52**: Core aligned with Chrome 143 stable. You pick up the latest security work, platform refinements, and the 143 UA‑CH major for sites that already gate on it.

### Fixes
- **x‑browser client marker (ENT Tier1)**: Only **Chrome brand** emits the x‑browser marker. Other brands no longer inherit it, which avoids unnecessary compatibility checks on non‑Chrome brands.
- **Android connection type**: Android emulation now reports the correct network connection type so network heuristics match the emulated device.
- **WebGL context attributes**: `getContext('webgl/webgl2', attrs)` receives the intended `contextAttributes` again, which improves driver compatibility and feature negotiation.
- **OOPIF devicePixelRatio**: Out‑of‑process iframes now inherit the right `devicePixelRatio`, keeping layout, media queries, and canvas scaling consistent across frame trees.
- **JS heap size limit**: `js_heap_size_limit` is read from the fingerprint in all environments so memory‑related probes no longer see host defaults.
- **matchMedia: device‑width / device‑height**: Media queries now reflect the actual emulated device metrics. Breakpoints and responsive rules evaluate to the expected values.
- **Android brand exposure**: `chrome.app` is no longer present in Android emulation, aligning the surface with what real mobile Chrome exposes.
- **Screen metrics from profile**: `screen.width/height` now reliably come from the profile on every path, avoiding one‑off host reads in edge cases.

### Improvements
- **SOCKS5H support**: Name resolution for SOCKS5H is more robust across platforms and failure modes. DNS resolution stays in the tunnel and connection setup is snappier on flaky endpoints.
- **Noise‑seed stability**: Noise seeds adapt more naturally to environment changes so fingerprints remain consistent across runs while keeping per‑profile diversity.

---

## [2025-11-29]
### New
- **Runtime timing scaler (ENT Tier1)**: `--bot-time-scale` compresses `performance.now()` deltas to emulate lower CPU load profiles for timing-sensitive research flows.
- **Deterministic noise seed (ENT Tier2)**: `--bot-noise-seed` deterministically reshapes the injected noise across Canvas 2D/WebGL/WebGPU imagery, text metrics/HarfBuzz layout, ClientRects, and offline audio hashes so each seed behaves like a reproducible fingerprint ID while remaining stable across sessions.
- **UDP over SOCKS5 (ENT Tier3)**: Automatic UDP associate for QUIC and STUN over SOCKS5 proxies; ICE presets often unnecessary when UDP is available.
- **socks5h proxy support**: Added support for `socks5h://` endpoints to resolve hostnames through the proxy tunnel.

### Fixes
- **Android text autosizing**: Adjusted Android profile emulation to avoid overly small fonts when Chrome 143’s `ForceOffTextAutosizing` defaults to enabled.
- **Cached-font CJK rendering**: Corrected a font cache edge case that could suppress CJK glyphs in some flows; characters now render consistently.


---

## [2025-11-24]
### Major
- **Chromium Core → 143.0.7499.40 (Early Stable)**: The core moves to Chrome 143 early stable. You gain the latest security work, platform refinements, and DevTools/CDP updates from the 143 line. Version‑based heuristics on target sites have less drift to key on, and UA‑CH now reports the expected major for 143‑gated features.

### Notes
- **API and feature parity**: Small shifts are expected around UA‑CH negotiation, CSS/JS behavior tightened by spec clarifications, and CDP domain schemas that reflect 143. Nothing in BotBrowser’s flag surface changes for this bump.
- **Rollout guidance**: If you pin site‑specific workarounds to a Chrome major, run quick validation on your critical flows with 143 before rolling to full traffic. A short canary helps catch sites that already gate on 143.


---

## [2025-11-17]
### Major
- **Chromium Core → 142.0.7444.163**: Engine updated to Chrome’s current stable. You get up‑to‑date security work and web‑platform behavior, and version‑based heuristics have less room to flag mismatches.

### New
- **Brand full‑version override**: `--bot-config-brand-full-version` sets the brand’s full version independently of the UA full version. Helpful where a vendor’s cadence diverges from Chromium and sites cross‑check UA‑CH with brand metadata.

Example (Edge spoofing):
```bash
--bot-config-browser-brand=edge \  # PRO feature
--bot-config-ua-full-version=142.0.7444.135 \  # PRO feature
--bot-config-brand-full-version=142.0.3595.65  # PRO feature
```

- **Opera brand**: `--bot-config-browser-brand=opera` is supported. UA, Client Hints, and brand cues are shaped to look like real Opera.

### Improvements
- **Canvas2D noise**: Noise insertion is steadier frame‑to‑frame and less tied to individual draw operations. Probes see a calmer fingerprint surface while the image stays the same.
- **Android DevTools ergonomics**: Under Android emulation, the inspector no longer inherits page zoom or CSS font scaling. Tool panes and monospace fonts stay consistent regardless of emulated viewport.

### Fixes
- **Touch emulation**: In touch mode, `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` could miss. The pointer/touch bridge is corrected; synthesized taps and clicks land reliably, including inside iframe trees.
- **Brave parity**: When brand=Brave, the UA full version and selected Client Hints are now hidden the same way real Brave does it.
- **Edge on Android UA**: User‑Agent construction for Edge on Android now carries accurate brand/version tokens and platform identifiers.

---


## [2025-11-10]
### Major
- **Chromium 142.0.7444.135 parity**: Synced core to the latest Chrome 142 stable build for up‑to‑date security patches, modern Web APIs, and version parity that reduces “version skew” signals used by anti‑bot systems.

### New
- **Locked user data directory protection**: On startup, if the provided `--user-data-dir` is already held by a running Chromium/BotBrowser process, BotBrowser now **shows a clear message and exits** instead of silently attaching to the old process. This prevents cross‑session contamination (cookies, storage, profile state) and hard‑to‑trace side‑effects.
- **OS‑specific AudioContext defaults**: Normalized **AudioContext** defaults per OS (e.g., base characteristics like sample rate/latency and related init parameters) so audio capability fingerprints line up with the target platform. This removes subtle OS drift that some risk engines use for anomaly scoring.

### Improvements
- **Emoji & font fallback stability across platforms**: Refined the font fallback chain and glyph selection so **emoji and CJK glyphs** render consistently on Windows/macOS/Linux. This reduces cross‑platform text‑metrics variance and avoids mixed‑glyph fallbacks that can change hashes or layout in edge cases.
- **Touch events in OOPIF**: Improved routing of emulated touch gestures for **Out‑Of‑Process IFrames (OOPIF)**, ensuring CDP commands like `Input.synthesizeTapGesture` work reliably inside OOPIF trees. Mobile flows embedded in cross‑origin iframes now respond as expected.

### Fixes
- **Ubuntu Bluetooth spoof leakage**: Fixed a Linux/Ubuntu‑specific issue where forged Bluetooth properties could leak inconsistent state. Spoofed Bluetooth exposure is now unified so websites can’t infer environment details from mismatched availability/signaling.
- **Media types (expand) default**: Resolved an issue where `--bot-config-media-types=expand` (and the default behavior) could be ignored in some scenarios. With this fix, local decoders are correctly surfaced so users can **select resolutions** on major video sites.
- **WebRTC SDP negotiation**: Corrected edge cases where SDP **audio codec selection or direction attributes** failed to negotiate. More robust media negotiation prevents call/setup loops and reduces fingerprinting surface from abnormal SDP.

---


## [2025-11-02]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 142.0.7444.60**  
  Synced with the latest Chrome 142 stable to keep rendering, networking, storage, and media behavior aligned with upstream, reduce version‑based heuristics, and inherit current security/perf updates.

### New
- **`--bot-config-disable-console-message` (PRO, default: true)**  
  Disables console message output to avoid CDP log noise leaking into the page context or logs in production environments and blocks Console.enable/Runtime.enable stack getter detections (e.g., redefining `Error.stack` before `console.log(err)`). Tracks: issue **#75**.
- **`--bot-config-fonts=expand` mode**  
  When a profile lacks specific fonts, `expand` will load additional system fonts to increase match rate and authenticity.

### Improvements
- **Scrollbar width fidelity across OSs**  
  More accurate per‑OS scrollbar metrics so `window.innerWidth` and `document.documentElement.clientWidth` remain consistent and layout shifts are avoided.
- **Cross‑platform font loading & caching**  
  Extracted common font sets across platforms, optimized render/cache logic, and **bundled Noto Sans** for broader coverage; improves paint time and UX while keeping fingerprint parity.
- **Auto‑language by IP**  
  Smarter locale selection based on proxy IP and region signals to choose a more appropriate UI language by default.
- **Android simulation without xdg‑open popups**  
  Suppresses spurious `xdg-open` invocations during Android emulation to prevent erroneous system dialogs.
- **CPU architecture realism (ARM vs x86)**  
  Tightened architecture‑specific surfaces (timings/caps) for higher authenticity when switching between ARM and x86 profiles.

### Fixes
- **Locale leakage via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale`**  
  Prevented host locale from surfacing unintentionally through `Intl` so locale now reflects the emulated/profiled environment.
- **WebGL stability under performance jitter**  
  Resolved a case where jitter modeling could destabilize WebGL metrics; GPU paths now remain stable with jitter enabled.
- **CJK font visibility**  
  Fixed scenarios where **Korean / Japanese / Chinese** glyphs could fail to render due to coverage/fallback mismatches.
- **Crash with `--bot-config-color-scheme`**  
  Corrected a crash that could occur when forcing color scheme overrides.
- **Headless window sizing with iframes**  
  Fixed an iframe handling bug that could mis‑apply window size in headless runs.

---


## [2025-10-23]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 142 (Early Stable)**  
  BotBrowser is now aligned with **Chromium 142** (Chrome Early Stable). This keeps Web Platform/DevTools semantics and browser surfaces consistent with upstream Chrome, reduces version‑based heuristics some detectors rely on, and includes the latest security and performance updates.

---

## [2025-10-20]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141.0.7390.108**  
  Synced to Chrome 141.0.7390.108 to stay aligned with the current stable engine for security patches, performance updates, and API parity. This reduces version‑based heuristics and keeps rendering/network/media behavior consistent with upstream Chrome.

### Improvements
- **Geo‑IP caching**  
  The resolved proxy public IP and derived geolocation are now cached and reused across page opens, cutting repeated lookups and speeding up initial navigation.

### Fixes
- **Window Controls Overlay attribute order**  
  Dynamic toggling of WindowControlsOverlay could reorder certain DOM attributes. The update stabilizes attribute order during toggles so the DOM signature remains consistent.

- **General stability**  
  Hardened several lifecycle and teardown paths that under specific edge conditions could lead to a crash.

- **Android Date/Time Picker**  
  Opening the native date/time picker while using Android profiles could crash in some environments. The initialization path has been corrected so the picker works reliably.

- **`--proxy-ip` with auto language/locale**  
  When a proxy IP was provided via `--proxy-ip`, automatic language and locale did not always align with the supplied region. Mapping now follows the provided proxy IP so UI language updates correctly.

- **Performance jitter alignment**  
  Modeling jitter could desynchronize timing between the main thread and Workers/SharedWorkers. Jitter seed and variance are now coordinated so threads remain time‑aligned while keeping natural variability.

- **Android emoji rendering**  
  Some Android profiles showed missing or incorrect emoji due to fallback mismatches. The emoji font availability and fallback chain have been corrected so shaping matches real Android.

- **Extensions + `--bot-config-always-active=true`**  
  Fixed a crash that could occur when loading extensions while the **always‑active** mode was enabled. Extensions now load reliably with the window kept active.

---

## [2025-10-12]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141.0.7390.77**
  - **What**: Sync to the latest stable Chrome 141 release.
  - **Why**: Keeps Rendering/Network/Storage/Media in parity with upstream, reduces version‑based heuristics, and includes current security fixes.
  - **Impact**: More deterministic behavior on sites that gate features by major version; lower drift on fingerprint surfaces impacted by minor engine changes.

- **Experimental: BotCanvasLab (Canvas2D recorder)**
  - **What**: An opt‑in tool that **records Canvas2D draw operations** and exports **replayable code snippets** (trace → code).
  - **Use cases**: Reverse‑inspect how a site draws charts/captchas/signature pads; reproduce rendering flows; compare visual diffs across hosts/profiles.
  - **Enable**:
    ```bash
    chrome.exe --no-sandbox --bot-canvas-record-file=/abs/path/trace.canvas.jsonl --bot-profile="C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\profile.enc"
    ```
  - **Notes**: Recording is **local** and grows with draw calls; recommended for analysis/debug, not for high‑volume production.
  - **Docs**: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/tree/main/tools/botcanvas

### New
- **CLI: `--bot-webrtc-ice` (custom ICE servers)**
  - **What**: Choose STUN/TURN presets or provide a custom list to **avoid TURN‑level IP disclosure**.
  - **Examples**:
    - Google preset:
```bash
      --bot-webrtc-ice=google  # PRO feature
      ```
    - Custom list (comma‑separated):
      ```bash
      --bot-webrtc-ice=custom:stun:stun.l.google.com:19302,turn:turn.example.com  # PRO feature
```
  - **Why**: Some probes (e.g., https://ipbinding.online/) try to infer the real network by observing TURN traffic; controlling ICE servers reduces unintended leakage.

- **CLI: `--bot-config-always-active` (true/false, default: true)**
  - **What**: Keep windows **active** even when unfocused.
  - **Behavior**: Suppresses `blur/visibilitychange`; forces `document.hidden=false`; caret keeps blinking; applies **per‑window** (multi‑window friendly).
  - **Why**: Certain sites degrade features or throttle actions when the tab isn’t considered active.

### Improved
- **Runtime features control (finer per‑OS toggling)**
  - More precise reading/toggling of runtime flags at startup, including OS‑conditioned switches → **more stable cross‑OS fingerprints** when moving profiles between Windows/macOS/Android.

- **Chrome component plugin preload (ID: `ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi`)**
  - Hardened preload path and timing so this stock component extension reliably appears; improves **Chrome‑authentic** signals that some scanners expect.

- **WebGL/WebGL2 parameter reads**
  - Reworked parameter access to avoid **application‑settable states** and cross‑driver quirks; prevents false values and closes detection patterns reported by https://fv.pro/

- **Media types default → `expand`**
  - `--bot-config-media-types` now defaults to **`expand`** (previously `profile`) so BotBrowser leverages **local decoders** by default → more accurate `canPlayType`/MSE decisions.
  - To keep old behavior, pass `--bot-config-media-types=profile`.

- **AudioContext noise tuning**
  - Adjusted distribution/phase to better defend against **audio fingerprinting** with minimal audible/timing side‑effects.

### Fixed
- **Font sizes stable under `--bot-config-noise-text-rects`**
  - Fixed an interaction where text‑rect noise perturbed computed font‑size metrics; sizes now remain stable.

- **Geolocation reliability**
  - Fixed geolocation not working in some configurations. Tracks: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/69

- **Android window sizing**
  - Corrected window metrics when emulating Android so viewport matches profile expectations.

- **Proxy robustness & validation**
  - Avoid crashes on failing proxies; emit clear error messages for malformed proxy arguments to prevent misconfig loops.


---

## [2025-10-02]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141.0.7390.55**  
  Aligned with the latest Chrome 141 for modern API parity, performance, and security fixes.

- **Built‑in Widevine Component (ENT Tier2)**  
  Widevine CDM is now bundled. No more per‑launch downloads via ComponentUpdater → faster, deterministic startup and fewer external requests.

### New
- **DRM Hardware Simulation (ENT Tier2)**  
  Adds platform‑specific DRM capability emulation to satisfy advanced probes on certain sites/platforms.

- **RLZ Re‑enabled**  
  Restores RLZ behavior to improve compatibility with Google services that expect it.

### Improved
- **Android Speech Voices**  
  More realistic `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` on Android profiles (language coverage, ordering, default selection) to better match real devices.

- **Cross‑platform Feature Parity (outside `runtime_enabled_features.json5`)**  
  Adapts a set of runtime capabilities not listed in the upstream JSON to keep platform‑agnostic fingerprints consistent across OS targets.

- **X‑Browser Identification (Google, ENT Tier1)**  
  Rewritten per Google‑recommended approach to increase Chrome authenticity signals.

- **Stability with Browser Brand Overrides**  
  Hardened brand‑switching paths to prevent occasional crashes under specific brand settings.

### Fixed
- **Screen Metrics from Profile**  
  `config.screen.width` / `config.screen.height` now consistently apply on startup and new windows.

- **Auto Language from Timezone**  
  Fixed a case where timezone‑driven locale auto‑detection could fail to update the UI language.

---

## [2025-09-27]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141**  
  Stay in lock‑step with the latest Chrome for modern API parity, performance, and security fixes.

### Compatibility / New
- **MediaCapabilities `decodingInfo` (DRM probing) hardening (ENT Tier2)**  
  Aligns responses with real‑Chrome behavior when sites probe **DRM capability** via `MediaCapabilities.decodingInfo` (e.g., H.264/H.265 + Widevine flow). Prevents capability mismatches and reduces a class of DRM‑support fingerprint checks.

### Fixed
- **Chrome component plugin preload**  
  Resolved an intermittent race where the default Chrome component plugin (**ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi**) might fail to load. Ensures consistent presence across sessions for scanners that expect it.

- **Android profile stability**  
  Fixed a crash that could occur when initializing **Android fingerprints** under certain setups (ordering/initialization edge cases). Improves reliability for mobile emulation.

---


## [2025-09-22]
### Improved
- **Audio fingerprinting on x86 (no-noise hardware modeling)**
  Refined DSP/stack paths so x86 architectures can produce **native‑like audio fingerprints without injecting noise**, improving pass rates on vendors that score audio stability.

- **Chrome brand fidelity & de‑Chromiumization**
  Audited and tuned brand/feature switches to better emulate **Chrome** and suppress Chromium‑specific traits, improving compatibility across brand detection systems.

### Privacy
- **First‑run telemetry suppression**
  Removed non‑essential Google statistics/metrics requests on initial launch to reduce network exhaust and improve privacy (and a small bandwidth win).

### Authenticity
- **Bundled Chrome component plugin**
  Preloads the stock Chrome component extension (**ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi**) to mirror real‑Chrome environments. Improves compatibility with fingerprinting tools like **fingerprint‑scan.com** that expect this presence.

### Fixed
- **Locale ↔ Speech voice alignment**
  When language auto‑detection adjusts the UI/locale, the **default speechSynthesis voice language** is now updated accordingly. Resolves mismatch flags observed by some probes (e.g., creepjs timezone/voice consistency checks).


---



## [2025-09-15]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 140.0.7339.128**
  Keeps BotBrowser in lock‑step with the latest stable Chrome for improved performance, security patches, and parity across modern web/APIs.

- **Proxy Subsystem Rewrite (faster • more stable • unified config)**
  Re‑architected proxy stack to reduce connection latency and flakiness. **Deprecated** `--proxy-username` / `--proxy-password`; now use a single **`--proxy-server`** (or profile) endpoint that supports **auth & multiple protocols** (e.g., `http(s)`, `socks5`). Example: `socks5://user:pass@host:port`.

- **Per‑Context Proxy (createBrowserContext)**
  You can assign a **different `proxy-server` per BrowserContext**, including authenticated endpoints. Enables multi‑proxy, high‑concurrency tasks in one process.
  Resolves: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/61

### Improved / Fixed
- **DNS Leak Hardening for SOCKS5**
  Fixed a case where domain resolution might occur locally under SOCKS5, preventing DNS leaks and strengthening stealth.

### New
- **CLI: `--proxy-ip` (profile key: `configs.proxy.ip`)**
  Provide the proxy’s public IP via CLI or profile so BotBrowser **skips per‑page IP lookups**, speeding up page open. Combine with `--bot-config-timezone` to emulate regions/timezones consistently.

- **CLI: `--bot-config-mobile-force-touch` (profile key: `configs.mobileForceTouch`)**
  Force **on/off** touch emission when simulating mobile devices. Useful for sites that require touch events regardless of the detected environment.
  Resolves: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/65

### Migration Notes
- Replace `--proxy-username/--proxy-password` with **embedded credentials in `--proxy-server`** (or in the profile).
  Example: `http://user:pass@ip:port`, `socks5://user:pass@ip:port`.


---

## [2025-09-06]
### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 140**
  Upgraded engine to Chromium **140** to maintain Chrome‑level parity and stealth consistency across APIs and anti‑bot surfaces.

### Improved
- **Slimmer Profiles (≈1.3 MB → ≈100 KB)**
  Refactored profile packaging **without reducing fingerprint coverage**. Results: faster startup, lower I/O, and lighter memory, which is better for high‑QPS orchestration and containerized runs.

### Fixed
- **WebGL2 `DRAW_BUFFER*`**
  Corrected an override that could set **`DRAW_BUFFER*`** state incorrectly during WebGL2 context creation, an issue certain sites probed for detection. The implementation now adheres to spec/real‑device values, restoring pass rates.

---


## [2025-09-02]
### Major Feature
- **Framework‑less Automation: `--bot-script`**
  - Execute a JavaScript file **right after BotBrowser starts** in a privileged, non‑extension context where **`chrome.debugger`** is available.
  - Build automation **without Playwright/Puppeteer** while still driving CDP via `chrome.debugger`: reducing framework/CDP leak surface and giving **pre‑navigation control**.
  - **Docs:** Chrome `chrome.debugger`: <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger/>
  - **Usage:** `botbrowser --no-sandbox --bot-profile=/absolute/path/to/profile.enc --bot-script=/path/boot.js`
  - **Examples:** [Bot Script Automation](examples/bot-script) (includes Cloudflare Turnstile automation)

### Improved
- **Embedded System Fonts (Cross‑OS)**
  - Bundled **more accurate system fonts** into resources so BotBrowser can emulate Windows/macOS/Linux text rendering with higher fidelity (wider glyph coverage, more consistent shaping/kerning).

- **Font Fallback Robustness (incl. Emoji)**
  - Tuned fallback chains so missing glyphs (emoji, CJK, rare symbols) resolve to the **same fonts a real device would use**.
  - Stabilizes **TextMetrics/Canvas** values and line‑breaking; strengthens resistance to **emoji/font‑based checks (e.g., hCaptcha)**.
  - **Workers parity:** Worker/SharedWorker/ServiceWorker now mirror the main thread’s fallback behavior to avoid cross‑thread hash mismatches.

---

## [2025-08-29]
### Major Update
- **Chromium 139.0.7258.156**
  Synced BotBrowser to the latest stable Chrome build for feature parity, current security patches, and minimized fingerprint drift.

### Added
- **Extended Media Types**
  Added broader `mediaTypes` coverage (e.g., `video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42C028"`) so capability checks reflect real browsers.
  *Improves MSE/EME and HTML5 playback compatibility.*

- **CLI: `--bot-config-media-types`**
  New override flag with modes: `profile`, `real`, and `expand` (allow expanding via local decoders). Fixes **#60**.
  *Lets you choose conservative profile-only behavior, native system reporting, or an expanded set when OS codecs are available.*

- **Performance Fingerprint Controls**
  Fine-grained tuning of performance surfaces (e.g., memory allocation timing, IndexedDB access latency, `requestAnimationFrame` delay).
  *Matches target host characteristics to resist high-sensitivity behavioral checks.*

- **Precise FPS Simulation**
  Emulate target refresh rate & input latency (e.g., simulate **120 FPS macOS** on Ubuntu).
  *Aligns rendering cadence and user input timing with the profiled device.*

- **GPUAdapter `textureHashes`**
  Added spoofing for `textureHashes` to strengthen GPU identity simulation.
  *Reduces GPU-surface inconsistencies across contexts.*

- **New Fingerprint APIs**
  Implemented `mediaCapabilities`, `videoDecoderSupport`, `audioDecoderSupport` and other WebCodecs-related capability signals.
  *Prevents easy capability-based bot detection.*

- **Faster Proxy IP Detection (Endpoint Race)**
  Parallel fetch to:
  `https://api64.ipify.org`, `https://ifconfig.me/ip`, `https://ident.me`, `https://icanhazip.com`, `https://checkip.amazonaws.com`, `https://ipecho.net/plain`.
  *Returns the first successful response to speed up network initialization.*

### Changed
- **Caches Off by Default**
  Disabled **GPU program cache** and **disk cache** by default.
  *Reduces persistent artifacts and cross-session correlation risk.*

### Improved
- **Ubuntu Cross-Worker Font Consistency**
  Workers (`Worker`/`SharedWorker`/`ServiceWorker`) now mirror the main thread's font defaults so emoji and special glyphs match.
  *Fixes CreepJS workers test (consistent canvas hashes across threads).*
  Test: https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/tests/workers.html

### Fixed
- **Profile-Induced Crash (Access Violation)**
  Resolved rare crashes caused by specific profiles.
  *Improves stability when loading edge-case profiles.*

- **Windows `--bot-title` Dock Label**
  The custom title now also applies to the Windows taskbar/dock icon.
  *Parses and displays the label consistently across OSes.*

- **HTTP Proxy with VPN (TUN Mode)**
  Fixed cases where HTTP proxying failed when a VPN in TUN mode was active.
  *Restores connectivity in mixed-network setups.*
