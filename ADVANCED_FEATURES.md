## Configuration & Control

### Advanced CLI Configuration
**[CLI overrides](CLI_FLAGS.md#profile-configuration-override-flags)** map to profile configs and take highest priority, so no profile edits are required.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Highest Priority:** CLI flags override profile settings
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Ideal for scripts and CI/CD
- **Session Isolation:** Clean separation across instances

**Examples (brand identity/UA overrides are PRO-tier features):**
```bash
# Override browser brand and WebGL settings
chrome.exe --bot-profile="C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\profile.enc" \
           --bot-config-browser-brand="edge"   # PRO feature

# Auto-detect location and language from proxy IP
chrome.exe --bot-profile="C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\profile.enc" \
           --bot-config-timezone="auto" \
           --bot-config-languages="auto" \
           --bot-config-locale="auto"
```

### Session Management
Comprehensive tools for session control and identification.

**Custom Titles and Labels:**
- `--bot-title` - Custom window title and taskbar/dock icon label
- Appears in window title bar and shows on taskbar/dock icon
- Displays as label next to toolbar Refresh button
- Perfect for managing multiple browser instances

**Session Data Management:**
- `--bot-cookies` - JSON string containing cookie data for startup
- `--bot-bookmarks` - JSON string containing bookmark data for startup
- Maintains session state across restarts
- Adds authenticity to browser fingerprint
- `--bot-inject-random-history` (PRO feature) - optional history augmentation for session authenticity

**Example:**
```bash
chrome.exe --bot-profile="C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\profile.enc" \
           --bot-title="Research Session A" \
           --bot-cookies='[{"name":"session","value":"abc123","domain":".example.com"}]' \
           --bot-bookmarks='[{"name":"Research","url":"https://example.com","folder":"Work"}]'
```

<a id="enhanced-proxy-system"></a>
### Enhanced Proxy System
Rebuilt for stability, per-context support (ENT Tier1 feature), and DNS-leak protection.

**Embedded Credentials:**
```bash
# HTTP/HTTPS proxy with credentials
--proxy-server="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
--proxy-server="https://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"

# SOCKS5 proxy with credentials
--proxy-server="socks5://username:password@proxy.example.com:1080"
```

Structured proxy usernames: Some providers encode routing hints in the username. BotBrowser supports separators like `,` and `｜` inside the username so formats like the following remain parseable:

```bash
--proxy-server="socks5://user_abc,type_mobile,country_GB,session_1234:11111@portal.proxy.io:1080"
```


**Per-Context Proxy Support (ENT Tier1 feature):**
```javascript
// Playwright example with different proxies per context
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  executablePath: './chrome', // BotBrowser path
  args: ['--bot-profile=/absolute/path/to/profile.enc']
});

// Context 1 with proxy A
const context1 = await browser.newContext({
  proxy: { server: 'http://user1:pass1@proxy1.com:8080' }
});

// Context 2 with proxy B
const context2 = await browser.newContext({
  proxy: { server: 'socks5://user2:pass2@proxy2.com:1080' }
});
```

Automatic geo-detection (ENT Tier1 feature): Each context derives timezone, locale, and languages from its proxy IP, so no manual setup is needed.

Performance tip: If all contexts share the same proxy IP, set `--proxy-ip` to skip repeated lookups.

**Performance Optimization:**
```bash
# Skip IP lookups for faster page loads
--proxy-server="http://user:pass@proxy.com:8080" --proxy-ip="203.0.113.1"
```

**DNS & IP Discovery**
- **DNS-leak protection:** SOCKS5 proxies prevent local DNS resolution, and all domain lookups go through the proxy tunnel.
- **UDP over SOCKS5 (ENT Tier3 feature):** Automatically attempts UDP associate to tunnel QUIC/STUN where supported; ICE presets can often be skipped when UDP is available.
- **Local DNS solver (ENT Tier1 feature):** Enable `--bot-local-dns` when you want faster resolution, want to avoid DNS poisoning, or your proxy provider restricts DNS behavior. This keeps DNS resolution local while the rest of the proxy and geo pipeline remains protected.
- **Custom public IP service:** Use `--bot-ip-service` to point BotBrowser at your preferred IP lookup endpoint when you need deterministic egress discovery or an in-house IP service. You can provide multiple endpoints separated by commas, and BotBrowser will race them and pick the fastest successful response.

**Important:** Always use BotBrowser's proxy options over framework-specific settings to ensure geo-detection remains accurate and protected.

```bash
# Example: true full-proxy QUIC/STUN (Chromium-level UDP associate, no ProxyChains hacks)
chromium-browser --bot-profile="/abs/profile.enc" \
  --proxy-server="socks5://user:pass@proxy.example.com:1080" \
  --bot-webrtc-ice=google  # PRO feature
```

<a id="network-fingerprint-control"></a>
## Network Fingerprint Control

**Scope:** Network-layer traits that tracking systems often score.

- **HTTP Headers & Protocol:** Chrome-like request headers; authentic HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 behavior (see Chrome Behavior Emulation).
- **DNS Routing:** SOCKS5 avoids local DNS resolution; all lookups go through the proxy tunnel (see Enhanced Proxy System).
- **UDP over SOCKS5 (ENT Tier3 feature):** Automatic UDP associate when supported to tunnel QUIC and STUN; ICE presets often unnecessary if UDP is available.
- **WebRTC:** SDP/ICE manipulation and candidate filtering to prevent local IP disclosure (see WebRTC Leak Protection).
- **TLS Fingerprints (JA3/JARM/ALPN):** Status: Roadmap: evaluation in progress; goals include cipher/extension ordering and ALPN tuning.

**Stack differentiators:**
- Per-context proxies with proxy-based geo detection (timezone/locale/language) across contexts and sessions
- DNS-through-proxy plus credentialed proxy URLs keep browser-level geo signals protected
- UDP-over-SOCKS5 tunnel (ENT Tier3 feature) for QUIC/STUN so ICE presets are only needed when UDP is unavailable
- Optional ICE control via `--bot-webrtc-ice` (PRO feature) when the proxy lacks UDP support
- Chromium-level implementation that avoids external Go/ProxyChains hijacking; tunneling lives inside the network stack

> Note: Most fingerprint browsers disable QUIC or avoid UDP entirely. BotBrowser implements UDP-over-SOCKS5 directly inside Chromium's network stack (no external proxy-chain hijacking) so QUIC/STUN stay proxied and consistent with TCP traffic.

## Privacy Protection & Fingerprint Randomization

### Multi Layer Fingerprint Noise
Deterministic noise generation prevents fingerprint collection and reproducibility. Configure all settings through CLI without modifying encrypted profiles.

- **Canvas**: `--bot-config-noise-canvas`
- **WebGL image**: `--bot-config-noise-webgl-image`
- **WebGPU**: Deterministic noise variance applied to WebGPU canvases by default so GPU-only analysis inherits the same reproducible noise characteristics without extra configuration
- **AudioContext**: `--bot-config-noise-audio-context`
- **ClientRects/TextRects**: `--bot-config-noise-client-rects`, `--bot-config-noise-text-rects`
- **Deterministic noise seeds (ENT Tier2 feature)**: `--bot-noise-seed=1.05` (1.0 to 1.2 range) enables reproducible yet distinct noise fields for Canvas 2D, WebGL, WebGPU imagery, text metrics with HarfBuzz layout, ClientRects, and audio hashes so each seed configuration produces protected fingerprints for research purposes.

Protection Model:
- Stable noise algorithms maintain Session Consistency while varying across different sessions
- GPU tuning preserves authentic WebGL and WebGPU behavior (1.0 and 2.0 contexts)
- Audio noise calibration (Chromium 141+) provides inaudible resistance to analysis while maintaining Cross-Worker Consistency
- Text metrics and ClientRects noise sustains realistic font measurements with Cross-Worker Consistency

<a id="active-window-emulation"></a>
### Active Window Emulation
Maintains protected window state to prevent focus-based tracking even when the host window is unfocused.

- `--bot-always-active` (PRO feature) defaults to `true`, maintaining protected `blur` and `visibilitychange` event patterns and keeping `document.hidden=false` for reliable API behavior
- Configurable per-window to allow legitimate focus-change observation when required by applications
- Protects against window focus based tracking heuristics that monitor caret blinking, FocusManager events, or inactive viewport throttling
- README quick link: see [Workflows → Active Window](README.md#advanced-capabilities)
- CLI reference: [`--bot-always-active`](CLI_FLAGS.md#⚙️-profile-configuration-override-flags)

### Headless & Incognito Compatibility
Consistent behavior across modes with comprehensive simulation.

**GPU Simulation in Headless Mode:**

- WebGL and WebGPU rendering consistency
- Hardware-accelerated video decoding simulation

**Incognito-Mode Enhancements:**
- Maintains fingerprint protection in incognito mode
- Consistent fingerprint between normal and incognito modes
- Maintains privacy features while ensuring protection
- For CLI launch guidance, see README “Quick Start” and [`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md#headless)

<a id="webrtc-leak-protection"></a>
### WebRTC Leak Protection
Complete WebRTC fingerprint protection and network privacy protection.

**SDP Control:**
- IPv4 and IPv6 Session Description Protocol (SDP) standardization across platforms
- ICE candidate filtering and protection management
- STUN and TURN server response standardization

**Real Time Communication Privacy:**
- MediaStream API protection across execution contexts
- RTCPeerConnection behavior standardization
- Network topology protection through controlled signal patterns
- ICE server presets and custom lists via `--bot-webrtc-ice` (PRO feature) to standardize STUN and TURN endpoints observed by page JavaScript
- Combined with UDP-over-SOCKS5 (ENT Tier3 feature) you achieve Chromium-level QUIC and STUN tunneling for complete network protection; see [`Network Fingerprint Control`](ADVANCED_FEATURES.md#network-fingerprint-control) and [`CLI_FLAGS`](CLI_FLAGS.md#⚙️-profile-configuration-override-flags) for implementation examples.

<a id="chrome-behavior-emulation"></a>
### Chrome Behavior Emulation

**Protocol Headers:**
- Standard HTTP headers matching Chrome specifications
- Consistent HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 behavior across platforms
- Standardized request timing and protocol patterns

**API Standardization:**
- Chrome compatible API implementations
- Consistent behavior with standard services integration
- Standardized JavaScript API responses matching Chrome specifications

**Widevine CDM Integration (ENT Tier2 feature):**
> Note: BotBrowser does not distribute proprietary modules (e.g., Widevine). End users must obtain playback components via official channels, and this integration is available only in ENT Tier2 feature.
